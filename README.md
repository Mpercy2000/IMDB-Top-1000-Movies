# IMDB-Top-1000-Movies
A statistical analysis of IMDB's top 1000 movies (Data sourced through Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows). I ran a linear multiple regression model to test if runtime, genre, and Metascore have a significant association in predicting box office gross revenue in USD. In the file "IMDB_Final_Paper.pdf" you will find a very detailed description of the entire process including: what methods were ran, why they were ran, how they were ran, and what conclusions were formed based on the statistical testing.
